## About me
Howdy! My name is Mikel, and I am a {age}-year-old programmer, lead robotics mentor, gamer, and wannabe cool guy. As a self-proclaimed "mega cat dude", I make my way through the internet silently judging everyone who comes into my sights. When I'm not judging, I'm probably gaming â€” Warframe, Minecraft, and Farming Simulator 22, currently. Otherwise, I can probably be caught having random political debates with family and friends. Sometimes, I may even put some of my (amazing) programming skills to use. Hence, I bring to you the creation of this very blog. So, "what the heck kinda programmer are you, anyway?" you may ask... Well...

## A Test
Just to give you a taste of how *great* I am, I am going to let you in on my little test. I have no idea if the following snippet will actually be what I want it to be, but I figure it's worth trying and this will allow me to be a little bit fancier with my future blog posts.
<button class="btn btn-secondary" on:click={() => alert("Whoa!")}>Click me!!</button>

## Another Test
Here's to hoping TailwindCSS (+ daisyUI) actually work in these posts, now!
<progress class="progress w-56"></progress>

## In all seriousness
Frankly, I expect to use this blog less than I initially intended. There is so much that I want to share, in general, so I kind of expect to take this blog up some time in the future. This may be that time (or not). So, who knows... If the tests above succeeded, I think I might have a little more fun than I expected. Otherwise, maybe that will be my motivation to make it work.
